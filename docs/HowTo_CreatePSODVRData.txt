Creating PSODVR data for ScalIT:

NOTE: This step is only required if you do not have analytical functions for the 1D optimized
effective potentials in the pot_$(MOL).f90 file.  This equates to having the following flags set.

1st Step (presinc module): useSP = T
2nd Step (JA3 module)    : useSP = T

In order for ScalIT to work, you must create data files that have the potential evaluated at a 
number of points so that it may spline fit this into effective potentials.  This is done by 
minimizing the potential with respect to a given set of coordinates, and adding that minimum to 
an array.  

We choose to use 3000 points for both here.  It is convenient to do 3001 points here, and then 
delete the last entry when moving the file into the ScalIT directory.  Note, when editing the file, 
the first line of the outputted data file should have the number of points on the very first line, 
then data afterward.  Thus, the finalized datafile should look the example in the documentation 
showing the file structure included in this documentation.
	
It is convenient in Mathematica to output in the comma separated value file format, and then edit 
formally in Excel, then output again in Excel.  Further formatting includes setting the total 
number of digits equal to 12 for both the length and effective potential value because Mathematica 
seems to use a varying number of significant digits when outputting.  I am not sure if this is 
necessary, but I know that it works.  Thus, each value will look like:
	
	0.1234567890 
	
when finalized in the complete data file.
