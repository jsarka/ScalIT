JA3 system addition notes:

1.) The following files are necessary to add system functionality.  This is for a triatomic 
	molecule.  For tetraatomic molecules, more files need to be added, but the overall
	theme is the same.  
	
	$(MOL) is the generic name I am using here to denote the name of the molecular 
	system.  If our system was HO2, then $(MOL)=ho2 for all of these files.

	The following needs to be put into the ScalIT/src/potentials/$(MOL) directory.  If the 
	directory does not exist, create it:
	
		ap.f90    $(PES).f    pot_$(MOL).f90    Makefile    $(MOL).drv.f90  
	
	The following files need to be put in the ScalIT/data/$(MOL) directory, if the directory
	does not exist, then create it:
	
		$(MOL)_vBR.dat  $(MOL)_vlr.dat  

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
    ap.f90         ---  file for calculating absorption potentials, only used for scattering
    $(PES).f       ---  Potential energy surface file.  The $(PES) refers to whatever the filename
						is called.
	Makefile       ---  This is an adapted copy of the low-level make file. Copy Makefile from
                        a working example, such as from ScalIT/src/systems/ho2 for so2, and modify the
                        MOL and MOD (="ja3" for triatomics) settings.
    pot_$(MOL).f90 ---  wrapper file that links the PES to ScalIT.  Just change the name of
                        $(MOL) to any given system that you are adding.  
    $(MOL)_vBr.dat ---  PSODVR data for 1st step.  This is only necessary if you plan to use 
	                    splining functions to create the optimized PSOVBR. This file is created 
					    outside of ScalIT. I currently use Mathematica to create this data, 
					    and will be explained in detail in a different file called 
					    HowTo_CreatePSOVBRData.
    $(MOL)_vlr.dat ---  Same as above, more PSODVR data, but for the little r Jacobi coordinate.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
2.) The main function in the wrapper for the potential needs to be named potJA3
    with the inputs of BR, lr, and theta, all double precision.  The function 
    itself is double precision.  If the PES used is in a coordinate system other than Jacobi
	coordinates, then this function should provide the necessary coordinate transformation.

3.) If you plan to use analytical functions for the optimized 1D effective potentials, then they are added
    into the pot_$(MOL).f90 file under the fitVBR and fitVlr subroutines for big R and little r 
	respectively.  If you plan to use splines and data files for the optimized potentials, then returning V0 as 
	0.0D0 is sufficient for those subroutines.  They must still exist, but they are not used.  An 
	example of this can be seen in the ho2 system under the pot_ho2.f90 file.
